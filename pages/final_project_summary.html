            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                After months of intensive learning and hands-on work, I have successfully completed my final project for postgraduate studies in Cybersecurity Engineering.
                The aim of this project was to build a modern, modular and secure home network, leveraging open-source tools and containerization to maximize security, flexibility and ease of management.
            </p>
            <p>
                The entire process required a lot of commitment and many hours of research, configuration, and troubleshooting. Every line of code and every Docker container deployed was the result of real-world problem-solving and continuous improvement.
            </p>

            <h2>What I Have Learned</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Advanced configuration and orchestration of <strong>Docker</strong> containers in real home network scenarios.</li>
                <li>Deploying and integrating multiple security solutions: <strong>Pi-hole, Unbound, Squid Proxy, Suricata IDS, Graylog, Prometheus, Grafana</strong>, and more.</li>
                <li>Practical skills in monitoring, logging, and incident detection in a self-hosted environment.</li>
                <li>Efficient network segmentation and firewall rules, with focus on both security and performance.</li>
                <li>Container networking, persistent storage, automated log collection and real-time data visualization.</li>
                <li>Adapting solutions to low-resource hardware (Raspberry Pi 5) and troubleshooting compatibility issues (especially on ARM64).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This project was not just an academic task — it was a deep dive into modern cyber defense, with direct application in everyday life.

            <h2>Personal Reflections</h2>
            <p>
                Completing this project was a great journey. I devoted over one and a half months of focused work, countless evenings reading documentation, debugging, and designing the architecture.  
                I am proud of the result, but even more proud of the skills I gained and the knowledge I can now share.
            </p>
            <p>
                I encourage everyone interested in practical cybersecurity to explore my code, guides, and diagrams.
