		<h2>About Wi-Fi Security Testing</h2>
		<p>
			This page focuses on testing the security of Wi-Fi networks using the 
			<a href="https://pl.lanberg.eu/produkt/bezprzewodowa-karta-sieciowa-wifi-lanberg-nc-0300-wie-usb-2-0-n300-1-wewnetrzna-1-zewnetrzna-antena" target="_blank">
			Lanberg NC-0300-WIE wireless card</a> with a Realtek chipset. 
			The tests aim to identify vulnerabilities in personal Wi-Fi networks and propose measures to improve their security.
		</p>
		<p>
			These tests require a wireless card that supports specific chipsets and can enter monitor mode. 
			Captured traffic during the tests is analyzed using Wireshark, a powerful network protocol analyzer.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is fascinating (and slightly ironic) that a card costing around 35 PLN (~8-9 dollars/euros) 
			can offer the capability to analyze and potentially hack various Wi-Fi networks. 
			This highlights the importance of understanding Wi-Fi encryption protocols and their vulnerabilities.
		</p>
		<p>
			During scanning, it is still possible to find networks that reveal the type of router in use, such as Orange FunBox or TP-Link routers. 
			These routers often use default passwords that are predictable, such as numeric strings of specific lengths. 
			For example, Orange FunBox routers have passwords of a fixed length, making them easier to guess.
		</p>
		<p>
			Wi-Fi networks are commonly secured using WPA2 or WPA3 encryption protocols:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>WPA2:</strong> This protocol, based on the AES encryption standard, provides strong security but is vulnerable to brute-force attacks, particularly if weak passwords are used.</li>
			<li><strong>WPA3:</strong> The successor to WPA2, WPA3 introduces Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) to protect against offline password attacks and offers improved encryption for open networks.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The primary difference between WPA2 and WPA3 lies in the enhanced security measures of WPA3. 
			By utilizing SAE for secure key exchanges, WPA3 strengthens resistance against dictionary attacks. 
			Additionally, it supports 192-bit encryption in enterprise mode, compared to WPA2's 128-bit encryption.
		</p>
		<p>
			To enhance Wi-Fi security, it is crucial to use these protocols along with strong, unique passwords. 
			Implementing additional measures such as changing default passwords, increasing password length, and renaming networks to avoid indicating the router type can further reduce vulnerabilities. 
			These practices help prevent unauthorized access and data breaches, safeguarding personal networks effectively.

		<!-- Wireless Interface Mode Configuration -->
		<section class="content-section">
			<h2>Configuring Wireless Interface Modes: Monitor and Managed</h2>

			<!-- Monitor Mode Configuration -->
			<h3>Command: sudo iwconfig lanbergwifi mode monitor</h3>
			<pre class="cmd-command"><code>kali@kali ~> sudo iwconfig lanbergwifi mode monitor</code></pre>

			<h4>What is Monitor Mode?</h4>
			<p>
				Monitor mode allows a wireless interface to capture all wireless traffic in the area, regardless of the intended recipient. 
				This is crucial for network analysis, penetration testing, and debugging wireless networks. In monitor mode, the network card 
				listens to all packets in the air, including management, control, and data frames. This allows you to observe and analyze 
				network traffic, detect vulnerabilities, and perform attacks such as packet sniffing or injecting packets.
			</p>

			<h4>Preliminary Steps Before Changing to Monitor Mode:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Before switching to monitor mode, ensure the interface is brought down by running:
					<pre><code>kali@kali ~> sudo ip link set lanbergwifi down</code></pre>
				</li>
				<li>After changing the mode, bring the interface back up by running:
					<pre><code>kali@kali ~> sudo ip link set lanbergwifi up</code></pre>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Attribute Legend:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>sudo</strong>: The command is run with superuser privileges, required for changing network configurations.</li>
				<li><strong>iwconfig</strong>: A command-line tool used for configuring wireless network interfaces in Linux.</li>
				<li><strong>lanbergwifi</strong>: The name of the wireless interface you are configuring (in this case, the interface is called `lanbergwifi`).</li>
				<li><strong>mode monitor</strong>: This sets the wireless interface to monitor mode, enabling it to capture all wireless traffic in the vicinity, not just the traffic intended for it.</li>
			</ul>

			<!-- Managed Mode Configuration -->
			<h3>Command: sudo iwconfig lanbergwifi mode managed</h3>
			<pre class="cmd-command"><code>kali@kali ~> sudo iwconfig lanbergwifi mode managed</code></pre>

			<h4>Why Switch Back to Managed Mode?</h4>
			<p>
				After completing testing or analysis in monitor mode, it is important to switch the wireless interface back to managed mode. 
				Managed mode is the default operating mode for most wireless devices, where the interface connects to a specific wireless 
				network (SSID) and communicates with other devices in that network. 
				In this mode, the network card is associated with an access point, allowing it to transmit and receive data to/from other devices.
				Leaving the card in monitor mode could interfere with normal network functionality, as the card will no longer be able to connect to 
				your wireless network.
			</p>

			<h4>Preliminary Steps Before Changing Back to Managed Mode:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Before switching back to managed mode, ensure the interface is brought down by running:
					<pre><code>kali@kali ~> sudo ip link set lanbergwifi down</code></pre>
				</li>
				<li>After changing the mode, bring the interface back up by running:
					<pre><code>kali@kali ~> sudo ip link set lanbergwifi up</code></pre>
				</li>
			</ul>

		<!-- WPA Handshake Capture Section -->
		<section class="content-section">
			<h3>WPA Handshake Capture and Output Analysis</h3>

			<p>The following command is used to capture a WPA handshake for a specific wireless network:</p>
			<pre><code>kali@kali ~> sudo airodump-ng -c 1 --bssid xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx lanbergwifi -w /home/kali/airodump-ng/xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx</code></pre>

			<p><strong>Explanation of the Command:</strong></p>
			<p>The command <code>airodump-ng -c 1 --bssid -w</code> is used for capturing WPA handshakes from a specific wireless network. Here’s what each part of the command does:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>airodump-ng:</strong> A tool used to monitor and capture packets from wireless networks.</li>
				<li><strong>-c 1:</strong> Specifies the channel to monitor (in this case, channel 1).</li>
				<li><strong>--bssid xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:</strong> Indicates the BSSID (MAC address) of the access point to monitor. Replace it with the MAC address of the target AP.</li>
				<li><strong>-w /home/kali/airodump-ng/xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:</strong> Specifies the location where the captured data, including the WPA handshake, will be saved.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><strong>Forcing a Handshake:</strong></p>
			<p>If the handshake is not automatically captured (e.g., no devices are actively reconnecting), you can force a disconnection of clients using the following command:</p>
			<pre><code>kali@kali ~> sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 100 -a XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX lanbergwifi</code></pre>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>--deauth 0:</strong> Sends an unlimited number of deauthentication frames to disconnect clients from the target AP.</li>
				<li><strong>-a XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:</strong> Specifies the BSSID (MAC address) of the target AP.</li>
				<li><strong>lanbergwifi:</strong> Indicates the wireless interface used for the attack.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This forces connected devices to reconnect, during which the WPA handshake can be captured.</p>
			
			<p>After running the command airodump-ng, the output shows details about the network and the captured handshake. Here’s a breakdown of the key elements of the output:</p>

			<pre><code>
			CH  1 ][ Elapsed: 3 mins ][ 2024-12-31 15:48 ][ WPA handshake: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

			</code></pre>

			<p><strong>Key Details:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>WPA Handshake:</strong> The message "WPA handshake: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx" indicates that a WPA handshake has been successfully captured. This is essential for cracking the password later.</li>
				<li><strong>Channel (CH):</strong> The network operates on channel 1, as indicated by the "CH 1" entry.</li>
				<li><strong>BSSID:</strong> The unique identifier of the access point (AP) is listed as "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx". This is the target AP for the attack.</li>
				<li><strong>ESSID:</strong> The network name (SSID) is "kali_24". This helps to identify the specific wireless network being monitored.</li>
				<li><strong>Encryption (ENC) and Cipher:</strong> The network uses WPA2 encryption with the CCMP cipher, which is common for secure WPA2 networks.</li>
				<li><strong>Associated Stations:</strong> Multiple stations are associated with the AP, as shown by their respective BSSIDs and the number of frames sent/received.</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The WPA handshake capture indicates that the handshake has been successfully collected for the network. This captured handshake can be used in further steps for password cracking, where tools like Hashcat can be employed to attempt to decrypt the password using methods such as dictionary or brute-force attacks. The next section will cover how to proceed with cracking the captured WPA handshake.</p>

			<h3>Cracking WPA Handshake Using HCXPCAPNG Tool and Hashcat</h3>

			<p>After capturing a WPA handshake, you can use <code>hcxpcapngtool</code> to convert the captured file into a format that can be used by <code>Hashcat</code> for password cracking. The following command demonstrates how to convert a WPA capture file to a <code>hc22000</code> hash format, which is compatible with Hashcat:</p>
			<pre><code>kali@kali ~> hcxpcapngtool -o output.hc22000 xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx.cap</code></pre>

			<p><strong>Explanation of the Command:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>hcxpcapngtool:</strong> A tool used to convert capture files (such as <code>.cap</code> or <code>.pcapng</code>) into hash formats that can be used for password cracking.</li>
				<li><strong>-o output.hc22000:</strong> Specifies the output file name where the converted hash will be saved.</li>
				<li><strong>xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx.cap:</strong> The input file containing the captured WPA handshake. Replace it with the path to your own capture file.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Once the capture file is converted, you can use <code>Hashcat</code> to attempt to crack the password using a dictionary or brute-force attack. The following command demonstrates how to run <code>Hashcat</code> on the generated <code>output.hc22000</code> hash file:</p>
			<pre><code>kali@kali ~> hashcat -m 22000 -a 3 output.hc22000 ?u?u?u?u?u?u?u?u?u?u?u?u?u?u?u</code></pre>

			<p><strong>Explanation of the Command:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>hashcat:</strong> The password cracking tool used to perform dictionary, brute-force, or hybrid attacks on various types of hashes.</li>
				<li><strong>-m 22000:</strong> Specifies the hash mode for WPA/WPA2 hashes. Mode 22000 is used for cracking WPA handshakes captured in the <code>hc22000</code> format.</li>
				<li><strong>-a 3:</strong> Specifies the attack mode. In this case, mode 3 is for brute-force attacks, which will attempt all possible combinations of characters.</li>
				<li><strong>output.hc22000:</strong> The file containing the captured WPA hash to be cracked.</li>
				<li><strong>?u?u?u?u?u?u?u?u?u?u?u?u?u?u?u:</strong> The mask used for the brute-force attack. In this case, it attempts all uppercase letters in a 15-character password. You can adjust the mask to match the password complexity.</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>Example Output from Hashcat:</strong></p>
			<pre><code>
			...
			[INFO] Hashcat v6.2.5 starting...

			[INFO] Hashes: 1 total
			[INFO] Attack: Brute-force

				<li><strong>[INFO] Hashcat:</strong> Displays the version and information about the cracking attempt.</li>
				<li><strong>Hash found:</strong> If successful, the cracked password will be displayed in the output. For example, <code>A1B2C3D4E5F6A1B</code> is the cracked WPA password.</li>
				<li><strong>Time:</strong> The time taken for Hashcat to perform the cracking attempt. In this case, it took less than 3 seconds.</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The above steps demonstrate how to capture a WPA handshake, convert it to a usable hash format using <code>hcxpcapngtool</code>, and then crack the password using <code>Hashcat</code>. By modifying the attack mode or mask, you can customize the brute-force process to fit different types of passwords. If you are using a more powerful machine than a virtual Kali Linux instance, you can install Hashcat for Windows and take advantage of the device's GPU for faster cracking performance.
