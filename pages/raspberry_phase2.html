			<h2>Graylog for Centralized Logging</h2>
			<p>Graylog plays a crucial role in my infrastructure by centralizing logs from various sources, including Suricata and Squid Proxy. Suricata, a powerful IDS/IPS system, provides detailed security event logs that help identify network threats and malicious activities. These logs allow for rapid detection and response to potential breaches, helping to maintain the security integrity of the environment.</p>

			<p>Similarly, Squid Proxy logs provide valuable insights into web traffic patterns, user activity, and potential access control violations. By aggregating Squid Proxy logs in Graylog, I can quickly spot unusual browsing behavior, blocked sites, or attempted policy violations, ensuring that all network traffic is closely monitored and managed.</p>

			<p>Graylog's ability to parse, search, and visualize these logs in a user-friendly interface simplifies threat analysis, incident response, and troubleshooting. By correlating the data from Suricata and Squid Proxy, I can get a holistic view of the network activity, enabling faster detection of anomalies and enhancing overall network security.</p>

			<h3>Why These Services Work Together</h3>
			<p>MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Graylog work together as a powerful log management stack. MongoDB is used by Graylog for storing configurations and metadata, while Elasticsearch serves as the backend for full-text search and fast querying of log data. Graylog acts as the centralized interface for log collection, search, and analysis.</p>
			<p>These three services must work together because:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>MongoDB</strong> is used by Graylog to store its configuration and metadata, ensuring that Graylog's setup is persistent across restarts.</li>
				<li><strong>Elasticsearch</strong> is where Graylog stores and indexes log messages, enabling fast search and analytics.</li>
				<li><strong>Graylog</strong> provides the web interface and API for accessing logs, as well as powerful search and dashboard features that rely on both MongoDB and Elasticsearch.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Log Collection with Filebeat</h3>
			<p>For collecting logs, we use Filebeat, which is installed directly on the host machine. Filebeat forwards log data to Graylog through Logstash, allowing real-time log analysis. Below is the Filebeat configuration:</p>

			<div class="docker-config">
				<pre><code>filebeat.inputs:
  - type: filestream
	id: suricata-logs
	enabled: true
	paths:
	  - /home/hunter/var-log-suricata/eve.json
	json.keys_under_root: true
	json.add_error_key: true
	fields:
	  log_type: suricata
	fields_under_root: true

output.logstash:
  hosts: ["127.0.0.1:5044"]</code></pre>
			</div>
			<p>This Filebeat configuration ensures that Suricata logs are captured and forwarded to Graylog via Logstash. The use of Filebeat in this stack ensures efficient log collection and reduces the load on the main services, allowing for optimal performance.</p>
