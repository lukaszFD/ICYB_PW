            <p>
                Hi! My name is Łukasz, and I am passionate about learning **cybersecurity** to expand my knowledge and protect digital environments. 
                With a background in software engineering and years of experience in developing secure APIs, I am diving deeper into ethical hacking, 
                penetration testing, and modern security practices. My goal is to not only understand the threats but also to create robust systems 
                that stand against them.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to use my skills to make the world a safer place, both online and offline, and contribute to the cybersecurity community. 
                Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn for collaborations or discussions about cybersecurity.
            </p>
