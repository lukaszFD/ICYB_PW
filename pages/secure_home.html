            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                In the modern digital age, online privacy and security are becoming more critical than ever. Cyber threats, data breaches, and intrusive advertisements are daily challenges for individuals and businesses alike. 
				In the near future, anyone who wants to exist securely in the digital world will need a mini-computer like a Raspberry Pi or Dell OptiPlex. A private DNS, Pi-hole, proxy, and other network filtering services will become standard for securing home networks. 
				With the right configuration, these tools can provide enhanced privacy, prevent unwanted tracking, and block malicious content before it reaches your devices.
            </p>
            <h3>Hardware Choice</h3>
            <p>
                For this project, I chose Dell OptiPlex instead of Raspberry Pi due to its greater flexibility in terms of performance and cost. 
				While Raspberry Pi is an excellent low-power device, Dell OptiPlex provides better processing power and upgrade options, making it a more sustainable long-term solution. 
				My Dell OptiPlex comes with 16 GB RAM, a 500 GB NVMe drive, and an Intel Core i5-7500T processor. 
				The additional RAM and processing power ensure that multiple services, including DNS filtering, network monitoring, and virtualization, run smoothly without performance degradation.
            </p>
            <h3>Operating System</h3>
            <p>
                I selected a Debian distribution without a graphical interface, ensuring minimal resource consumption and reducing attack vectors. A command-line-based system enhances security by limiting the number of installed libraries and background processes. 
				By running only the essential services, Debian provides a stable and efficient environment for network filtering and monitoring. 
				Additionally, regular security updates and a strong open-source community make Debian one of the most reliable choices for securing a home network infrastructure.
            </p>
            <h3>Benefits of Private DNS, Pi-hole, and Proxy</h3>
            <p>
                Implementing a private DNS, Pi-hole, and a proxy server significantly enhances security and privacy. Pi-hole acts as a network-wide ad blocker, preventing advertisements and trackers from loading on any connected device. 
				This reduces bandwidth usage and enhances the browsing experience. Integration with the <a href="https://cert.pl/lista-ostrzezen/" target="_blank">CERT Polska</a> list allows automatic blocking of phishing sites, further protecting against cyber threats. 
				Additionally, blocklists from <a href="https://firebog.net/" target="_blank">Firebog</a> and <a href="https://adaway.org/hosts.txt" target="_blank">AdAway</a> add another layer of security by filtering out known malicious domains. 
				By using a proxy, all outbound traffic can be inspected and filtered to prevent access to potentially harmful websites.
            </p>
            <h3>Network Monitoring and Protection</h3>
            <p>
                Continuous network monitoring is crucial for identifying and mitigating potential threats. The system is equipped with services that analyze network traffic in real time, detect unusual behavior, and generate alerts for potential intrusions. 
				By leveraging tools like Suricata or Snort, deep packet inspection can be performed to identify malicious traffic patterns. Additionally, logging mechanisms allow for historical analysis, helping to identify trends and potential vulnerabilities. 
				This proactive approach significantly enhances the overall security posture of a home network.
            </p>
            <h3>Flexibility and Virtualization</h3>
            <p>
                With Proxmox, I can easily test different solutions, deploy new services, and scale the system as needed. Virtualization allows me to run multiple isolated environments, ensuring that one service does not interfere with another. 
				For example, a separate virtual machine can be dedicated to DNS filtering, another to network monitoring, and another to logging and analytics. 
				This modular approach not only increases security by isolating services but also allows for easy recovery in case of misconfiguration or failure.
            </p>
            <h3>Open Project</h3>
            <p>
                This <a href="https://github.com/lukaszFD/home-network-guardian" target="_blank">project</a> is an ongoing effort to develop an optimal home network security solution. After testing various configurations and services, I will refine the setup and share detailed guides with the community. 
				The goal is to create a highly customizable and effective security system that can be adapted to different needs. All configurations, scripts, and step-by-step tutorials will be documented on this page and my GitHub repository to help others implement similar solutions in their own homes.
