# Cybersecurity Learning Projects & Resources

This is a **public repository** where I share code, scripts, and analyses related to my learning journey in cybersecurity. The repository serves as a central place for my experiments, documentation, automation scripts, and sample projects developed as part of my postgraduate studies at Warsaw University of Technology.

**Here you will find:**
- Source code for my project websites (`pages` folder, `index.html`)
- Visualizations, diagrams, and screenshots (`assets`)
- Custom CSS styles (`css`)
- Sample scripts for automation, analysis, and monitoring (`sample_scripts`)
- Example network and security analyses (`analyses`)
- Test files for various scenarios (`tests`)

The repository is both a **knowledge base** and a practical toolkit for anyone interested in hands-on cybersecurity, open-source tools, and network security concepts.
